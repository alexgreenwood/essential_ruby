# Suppose we are building a loan payment calculator.

# Define a method called "pmt" which will accept three arguments:
#  - interest rate
#  - number of payments
#  - principal value of loan
# The method should return the size of each payment given these three things.
# Before we can teach the computer how to automate a task,
#   we usually have to do some research on how the task is done:
#   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_calculator

def pmt(rate, nper, pv)

((rate/12) * pv)/(1 - ((1 + (rate/12))**(-nper*12)))

end

puts "Your monthly payment will be #{pmt(0.065, 30, 200000)}."
